# webSecurity

This is the repository for the AMIS Web Security SIG held at thursday 6th of June 2019. This repository is used in the hands-on part of the SIG where participants implement their own token-based authentication (client-side).
The repository consists of three parts:

## Backend
The application uses a Spring-Boot backend. See /backend/README.md for instructions for running it locally; it uses Java 8+. The backend is also available at 10.252.252.206:8080 (AMIS network).

## Frontend
The application uses either an Angular or a React frontend (participants choice). See /angular/README.md or /react/README.md for instructions.
